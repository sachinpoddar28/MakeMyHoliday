What architecture will you recommend for the solution and why?
Ans: We will follow Mulesoft API architecture.
	 1. Because it donot exposed the backend data and codes and only exposes the importand things to the customers.
	 2. Process APIs are less volatile compared to System APIs.
	    If we use normal API architecture, if some lower level architectute chnages, we need to change the whole API structure.
		Therefore Mulesoft architectute will be preffered.
